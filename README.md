# React Component Viewer

Have you ever thought how that would be cool to have a look at your component? No.. not in a huge project that you are working on! Just your small on a blank page without all that stuff: redux, async actions, containers and all that shit that I'm sure you are very proud of :)

Would it be cool to work on your components independently, automatically generate random mock data and replace the props, play around with these props on the page, right there in the browser?
